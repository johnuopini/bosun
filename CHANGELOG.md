All notable changes to bosun are documented here. Format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/); the project
uses [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [0.3.7] — 2026-05-19

### Fixed
- **Restart-in-place was dropping the first character of the launch
  command** under async prompts (powerlevel10k, spaceship) and after
  agents that print a multi-line shutdown message. The `send-keys -l`
  arrived while zsh's line editor wasn't ready yet, so `claude …`
  showed up as `laude: command not found`. Restart now does
  `C-c → wait → C-c → longer wait → Enter → C-u → command`, which
  forces the prompt to repaint and clears any residue before the
  command lands.
- **Homebrew release workflow** now pulls release tarballs via
  `gh release download` from the just-created release page instead
  of `actions/download-artifact@v4`, which was intermittently 403ing
  on `ListArtifacts` when `update-formula` and `publish-crate`
  raced against the same artifact API endpoint after `release`.

## [0.3.6] — 2026-05-19

### Changed
- **`R` on a live session now restarts in place.** Instead of killing
  the tmux session and creating a new one with a fresh internal name,
  `R` sends `Ctrl-C` twice (covers agents that swallow the first
  interrupt to confirm) and then re-types the launch command in the
  same pane. The session, its internal name, and the sidebar slot are
  all preserved — no ghost rows, no jump to the end of the list, no
  selection bounce.

### Fixed
- **Ghost dead row on restart.** The previous kill-and-recreate path
  fired an intermediate `SessionsRefreshed` (between the kill and the
  create) which prematurely consumed the pending restart-swap state,
  so the new internal name was appended at the bottom while the dead
  `? <name>` ghost stayed in the old slot. The dead-row
  restart-from-recents path still uses swap, but now only consumes it
  when `select_after` is actually set — intermediate refreshes pass
  through harmlessly.
- **Homebrew formula on Intel macOS** (yetidevworks/bosun#1). The
  release workflow now writes top-level `if OS.mac?` / `if OS.linux?`
  guards with an `else` fallback for the arch, instead of the nested
  `on_macos do ... on_intel do` DSL. The latter form fails on
  Homebrew 5.x setups where `Hardware::CPU.*` returns `:dunno` and
  both `intel?` and `arm?` evaluate to `false`, leaving the formula
  with no URL registered and breaking `brew info` / `brew outdated`.

### Internal
- New `TmuxClient::restart_in_place(session, command)` method:
  `send-keys C-c` (×2 with a 120ms gap) followed by `send-keys -l
  <command>` and `send-keys Enter`. Mirrors the create path's idiom
  but skips the new-session step.
- `Command::RestartSession` handler in the tmux actor now uses
  `restart_in_place` instead of `kill_session + create_session`.
- Reducer no longer captures `pending_restart_swap` for live restart
  (the internal name doesn't change). Dead-row restart-from-recents
  still captures swap and now uses `as_deref()`-based consumption so
  intermediate refreshes don't clear the state prematurely.

## [0.3.5] — 2026-05-18

### Added
- **`bosun release-notes` subcommand.** Pages the `CHANGELOG.md` that
  was embedded in the binary at compile time. Honors `$PAGER`, falls
  back to `less -RFX` and then `more`. Piping (`bosun release-notes |
  grep …`) prints directly without a pager.

## [0.3.4] — 2026-05-18

### Added
- **`bosun update` subcommand.** Checks the latest GitHub release and
  upgrades in place. Detects how the running binary was installed and
  routes accordingly:
  - **Homebrew** (`/Cellar/`, `/homebrew/`) → prints `brew upgrade bosun`.
  - **Cargo** (`~/.cargo/bin/`) → prints `cargo install --force bosun-tmux`.
  - **Standalone binary** (anywhere else, including `~/.local/bin/bosun`
    from `make install`) → downloads the matching
    `bosun-<platform>.tar.gz` from the GitHub release, extracts to a
    temp dir, and atomically swaps it into place. Safe to run while a
    TUI session is attached — the running process keeps its mmap'd
    binary; the new one takes effect on the next launch.
- **`bosun update --check`.** Reports whether a newer release exists
  without downloading or installing anything.
- **`bosun --help` / `bosun help`.** Lists the available subcommands
  and the `BOSUN_LOG` env var.

### Internal
- New `src/commands/update.rs` (port of ygrep's `commands/update.rs`,
  adapted to bosun's release-asset naming and `directories::ProjectDirs`
  data dir). Update cache lives at
  `<data_dir>/update-check.json`.
- New deps: `ureq` (with the `json` feature) for the GitHub API call
  and asset download, `serde_json` for the API response.

## [0.3.3] — 2026-05-18

### Changed
- **Scroll-wheel direction inverted.** Wheel/trackpad pan over the
  session list now matches macOS natural-scroll semantics on both
  desktop and mobile clients (Termius, Blink): swiping content
  downward moves the selection up, and vice versa.
- **Scroll sensitivity throttled.** A single trackpad gesture no
  longer flies through the list — wheel events accumulate and step
  the selection every two ticks. Counter-flicks reset the
  accumulator so reversing direction feels immediate.

### Fixed
- **Restart no longer leaves a "? &lt;name&gt;" ghost row.** Restarting
  a session (live `R` or dead-row restart-from-recents) now swaps
  the new internal name into the old row's slot — same section,
  same position — instead of appending the new session at the
  bottom while a dead ghost sits above it.

### Internal
- `SidebarModel::replace_session(old, new)` swaps an internal name
  in place across `ungrouped` and section members.
- `AppState.pending_restart_swap` captures the old internal at
  modal-confirm time; the next `SessionsRefreshed` consumes it
  before `reconcile` so the new session inherits the slot.
- Scroll handling: new `SCROLL_TICKS_PER_STEP` constant + per-state
  `scroll_accum` for the throttle; direction flip lives in the
  `MouseEventKind::Scroll{Up,Down}` arms of `handle_mouse`.

## [0.3.2] — 2026-05-15

### Added
- **Sidebar survives tmux restarts and reboots.** `SidebarModel::reconcile`
  no longer auto-drops dead sessions; entries are removed only when the
  user explicitly hits `d`. A tmux server restart (or full reboot) no
  longer wipes section structure or ordering.
- **Friendly labels on dead sidebar rows.** Missing-session rows now
  render the original display name (looked up in the Recents store via
  slug match) instead of the raw internal `bosun-slug-hex` name. Falls
  back to the slug, then the internal name, if no Recent matches.
- **`R` restarts dead sessions from Recents.** Pressing `R` on a
  missing-session row resolves the slug → Recent and fires
  `CreateSession` with the stored spec. The session lands back in its
  original section (via `session_history`). The dead row stays until
  you `d` it, so accidental Esc on the confirm doesn't lose data.
- **`d` works on dead rows too.** Confirms with "Remove from sidebar?"
  and uses the same `KillSession` path (idempotent on dead sessions).

### Internal
- `slug_from_internal(internal, prefix)` reverses `build_internal_name`,
  returning `None` on shape mismatch (foreign session names, unknown
  prefix, malformed suffix). Unit tests cover the happy path and the
  reject cases.
- `AppState` gained `session_prefix: String` and `recents: Vec<Recent>`,
  populated at startup and refreshed on every `SessionsRefreshed` so
  dead-row resolution always uses the latest store.
- `slugify` made `pub(crate)` so `dead_display_for` /
  `recent_for_internal` can match across the same canonicalization
  that `build_internal_name` originally applied.

## [0.3.1] — 2026-05-15

### Fixed
- CI: `cargo fmt` and `cargo clippy -D warnings` formatting / lint nits
  in v0.3.0 that broke the release workflow on tag push. No
  user-visible behavior change.

## [0.3.0] — 2026-05-15

### Added
- **MRU session cycle bindings.** `shift+←` and `shift+→` (prefix-less)
  jump between recently-attached sessions without going back to the
  bosun TUI. Left toggles to the previous session; right walks one
  step further back in MRU order. `__bosun_monitor` is excluded so the
  cycle never lands on the internal control-mode session.
- **Quick-jump session picker (tmux).** `prefix + o` opens a floating
  tmux popup running `choose-tree -Zs` — type-ahead fuzzy session
  chooser. Enter switches, Escape closes. `__bosun_monitor` is
  filtered out.
- **Quick-jump session picker (TUI).** Press `/` in the bosun session
  list to open a centered modal with a live filter. Matches against
  session display name, agent, and path. Up/Down to highlight, Enter
  attaches, Esc cancels.

### Changed
- **Status bar overhaul.** Bar now reads
  `⚓ bosun · <current-session-name>` on the left and
  `^Q detach · S-←→ cycle · C-a 1-9 jump` on the right. The current
  session name is pulled from each session's `@bosun_display` user
  option (fallback to `#S`). Replaced the per-session chip strip
  (`1:foo 2:bar …`) which became unhelpful past ~5 sessions. The
  prefix+1..9 jump bindings still install and work — just no longer
  rendered in the bar.

### Internal
- `attach.rs` lifecycle now owns three runtime binding sets: the
  existing `C-q detach`, the new `S-Left`/`S-Right` cycle, and the new
  `prefix + o` quick-jump. All three self-heal on every refresh tick
  via `do_refresh` and are torn down on `GlobalsGuard::drop` plus the
  panic-hook `emergency_unbind`.
- Format-expansion escaping: tmux re-expands `run-shell` and
  `display-popup` arguments at trigger time, so the bindings that
  contain `#{…}` formats now double them as `##{…}` to survive the
  expansion intact. Documented inline next to each binding.
- `Command::Attach` from a closing modal is now intercepted by the app
  loop and re-routed to `pending_attach` (the actor ignores
  `Command::Attach` — only the app loop can do the tty handover).

## [0.2.14] — 2026-05-14

Last release before the navigation overhaul. See git history for
prior changes.
