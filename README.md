# Bosun

![Bosun Screenshot](screenshot.png?3939393)

Tmux-native orchestrator for AI agent sessions. Written in Rust with
[ratatui](https://ratatui.rs/).

Bosun lists, previews, creates, and manages tmux sessions running AI coding
agents (Claude Code, Codex, or a plain shell) from a single terminal UI. It
was built as a from-scratch reimagining of
[agent-deck](https://github.com/yetidevworks/agent-deck) — same workflow, new
architecture, designed around a few rules that keep it simple and robust:

- **Tmux is the source of truth.** Bosun receives push notifications from
  tmux via control mode (`tmux -C`). No shared database state to race on;
  multi-instance coexistence is trivial because every bosun reads the same
  tmux server.
- **Actor pattern, single-writer app state.** One task owns tmux I/O, one
  task owns `AppState`. No nested mutexes, no `Arc<Mutex<...>>` scattered
  across the render path.
- **Dedicated tmux socket.** Bosun runs its sessions on `tmux -L bosun` by
  default so it never touches your other tmux state, and so Claude Code's
  macOS Keychain auth lineage flows through bosun's process tree correctly.
- **Per-session status bar.** Bosun writes its status line with
  `set-option -t <session>`, never globally, so non-bosun sessions on the
  same server are untouched.
- **Opencode aesthetic.** Borderless, subtly shaded panels, bold accents,
  modal dialogs with left accent bars and drop shadow. Fifteen built-in
  themes — ten dark (opencode, tokyonight, dracula, catppuccin-mocha,
  one-dark-pro, ayu-mirage, nord, gruvbox-dark, rose-pine, github-dark)
  and five light (github-light, one-light, solarized-light, ayu-light,
  quiet-light) — switched live with `t`.

## What's new in 2.0

The 2.0 branch turns bosun from a session picker into a working surface.
The preview pane is no longer a snapshot — it's a real embedded terminal
you can click into and drive without leaving bosun.

- **Embedded terminal preview.** The selected session renders live from a
  real PTY (`portable-pty` + `vt100` + `tui-term`), parser-primed on
  switch so there's no scrollback replay animation. No more 1 fps
  snapshot polling for the focused row.
- **Single-window focus mode (`s` to toggle).** Press Enter on a session
  and it opens *inside* the preview pane instead of going full-screen
  tmux. The sidebar stays visible the whole time. `Ctrl+Q` exits focus,
  same chord as the classic detach. A colored focus border marks
  whichever pane has the keyboard.
- **Two-way mouse navigation.** Click a session row to jump to it and
  exit focus; click inside the embed to enter focus on it. Drag the
  divider to resize. Scroll wheel scrolls the sidebar.
- **Live per-session status.** The `●◐○✕` glyphs in the sidebar now
  update at ~5 Hz across every managed session (not just the focused
  one), driven off the fast preview tick. Claude / Codex detectors
  recognize the prompt-box UI directly instead of scanning the whole
  capture for fragile substrings, which kills the "stale Thinking…
  pegs the glyph to Running" failure mode.
- **Sections.** Group sessions into named, optional, collapsible buckets
  (`g` to create, Tab to collapse). Persisted in `config.toml`. Banner
  fonts cyclable per-section (`f` on a header) for visual distinction
  in the preview pane.
- **Editor key (`e`).** With a session highlighted, press `e` to open
  the session's path in your configured editor (`zed`, `code`, `subl`,
  `nvim`, etc.). Set it once with `bosun editor <cmd>`.
- **Modify session (`m`).** Open the new-session modal pre-filled
  from the highlighted session's stored spec — change the name,
  path, agent, or flags (e.g. add `--resume` after the fact).
  Save-only: the running agent keeps its current flags; the next
  `R` (restart) picks up the new spec.
- **Tabs inside a sidebar entry.** Each sidebar row is now a
  *container* that can hold multiple tmux sessions ("tabs"),
  surfaced as a browser-style strip above the embed with a `+`
  button on the right. Single-tab containers behave identically
  to a session row. `Ctrl+T` (or click `+`) opens a slimmed-down
  new-session modal with the path locked to the container; the
  new session joins the container and survives a tmux server
  restart via the `@bosun_container_id` user option. Tab status
  glyphs render next to each pill so background tabs surface
  Running / Waiting state without focus; the sidebar row picks
  up a small accent dot when any background tab is busy.
  `Shift+→ / Shift+←` cycle tabs, `Shift+↓ / Shift+↑` cycle
  sessions — same chord in both sidebar and focused modes.
  `Shift+D` kills a whole container at once; plain `d` kills the
  active tab (drops the container when the last tab goes).
- **Sidebar-order session cycle.** Shift+↓ / Shift+↑ walk the
  next / previous live session in sidebar order (stable, not
  MRU-shuffled), in both sidebar and focused modes. Sidebar
  selection follows the embed switch automatically.
- **Input correctness for agents in the embed.** DECCKM cursor-key
  application mode, bracketed paste forwarding (drag-drop an image →
  Claude sees `[Image #N]`), SGR 1006 mouse forwarding, modifyOtherKeys
  for Shift+Enter / Ctrl+Backspace / etc.
- **Self-update.** `bosun update` swaps the binary in place from the
  latest GitHub release; `bosun update --check` just reports what would
  happen. `bosun release-notes` opens the changelog for the running
  version.

## Features

- Live session list with live status detection
  (`●` running · `◐` waiting · `○` idle · `✕` error) refreshed across
  every managed session at the fast-preview cadence
- Embedded live preview of the selected session — real PTY in the
  right pane, focusable in place via single-window mode
- Tabs (multi-session containers) per sidebar row with a browser-
  style tab strip, `Ctrl+T` / `+` to add, `Shift+D` to nuke the
  whole container, per-tab status glyphs, and survival across tmux
  restart via `@bosun_container_id`
- Sections for organizing sessions, collapsible, persisted in
  `config.toml`
- Create new bosun-managed sessions from a modal form: name, path, agent
  choice, and agent-specific options (Claude `--continue` / `--resume` /
  skip-permissions, Codex `--yolo`)
- Filesystem tab-completion in the path field (shell-style LCP matching
  against live directory contents)
- Recent sessions picker (`Ctrl+R` from the new-session modal) backed by
  SQLite, with live substring filter and delete-from-list
- Quick-switch (`/`) — type-ahead session picker against name / agent /
  path
- Session lifecycle: attach (`Enter`), rename (`r`), restart (`R`),
  modify (`m`), kill (`d`), open in editor (`e`)
- Fifteen built-in themes (10 dark + 5 light) plus user themes from
  `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/bosun/themes/*.toml`; live preview picker on `t`
- Two-way mouse navigation: click rows to jump, click the embed to focus,
  drag the divider to resize
- Config file at `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/bosun/config.toml` with `theme`,
  `session_prefix`, `tmux_socket`, `preview_tick_ms`, `single_window`,
  `editor`, `banner_font` knobs (env vars still override)
- One-key detach: `Ctrl+Q` inside any attach (full-screen or
  single-window focus) returns you to bosun without touching your tmux
  prefix or leaving stray bindings behind
- Self-update via `bosun update`; release notes via `bosun release-notes`

## Requirements

- Rust 1.80 or newer
- tmux 3.x (tested against 3.6)
- macOS or Linux (Windows is not supported)

## Installation

### Homebrew (recommended)

```bash
brew install yetidevworks/bosun/bosun
```

### From crates.io

```bash
cargo install bosun-tmux
```

(The crate is published as `bosun-tmux` because `bosun` is reserved on
crates.io; the installed binary is still `bosun`.)

### From source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yetidevworks/bosun
cd bosun
cargo install --path .
```

### Pre-built binaries

Download from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/yetidevworks/bosun/releases).

## CLI subcommands

Bosun runs the TUI when invoked with no arguments. The handful of
subcommands all run synchronously and exit before any TUI / tmux
machinery starts.

| Command | Action |
|---------|--------|
| `bosun` | Launch the TUI |
| `bosun update` | Download and install the latest release in place |
| `bosun update --check` | Report whether an update is available; don't install |
| `bosun release-notes` | Open the changelog entry for the running version |
| `bosun editor` | Print the currently configured editor |
| `bosun editor <cmd>` | Set the editor used by the `e` key (e.g. `bosun editor zed`) |
| `bosun editor ""` | Clear the configured editor |
| `bosun help` / `--help` / `-h` | Print usage |

## Single-window mode

By default `Enter` on a session does a full-screen `tmux attach` — the
sidebar disappears, you drive the session, `Ctrl+Q` brings the sidebar
back. Familiar from earlier versions and from `tmux attach` itself.

Single-window mode (toggle with `s`, persisted to `config.toml` as
`single_window = true`) keeps the sidebar visible. `Enter` switches the
embedded preview into a writable, focused mode on the selected session
and routes your keystrokes to its PTY. `Ctrl+Q` exits focus back to the
sidebar without losing the view. Click the embed to focus in, click the
sidebar to focus out — works in either direction.

The colored focus border around whichever pane has the keyboard tells
you where typing will land. When you exit focus, the border moves to
the sidebar.

## Modifying a session

Press `m` on a live session to open the new-session modal pre-filled
from its stored spec — name, path, agent, agent flags. Edit any
field, hit Enter to save. Bosun rewrites the per-session `@bosun_*`
tmux user options so the change persists; the recents picker also
reflects the new spec on the next open.

The save is **non-destructive**: the running agent process keeps its
existing flags. The next time you press `R` (restart), the new spec
is what gets recreated — same code path Restart already uses. So the
common "I forgot to launch Claude with `--resume`" recovery becomes
`m` → cycle the session-mode field to `Resume` → Enter → `R`.

Modifying works the same whether you're focused in the embed or
sitting on the row from the sidebar.

## Status detection

Bosun classifies each managed session as Running, Waiting, Idle, or
Error and renders the glyph in the sidebar. Detection runs on the fast
preview tick (default 200 ms) for every managed session, not just the
focused one, so a multi-agent dashboard reflects state in near
real-time.

Detectors are stacked by priority (Claude > Codex > generic). Each
looks at the bottom region of the visible pane capture — Claude's
prompt box, Codex's working line — rather than substring-scanning the
whole screen. Older "Thinking…" lines that scrolled past the prompt no
longer pin the glyph to Running.

Transitions are smoothed:

- → Running or → Waiting: **instant**. High-signal events; the user
  wants to see "agent woke up" or "agent wants my input" with no delay.
- → Idle: requires two consecutive matching polls. Filters the brief
  quiet windows between agent bursts so the Running glyph doesn't
  flicker off mid-response.

## Mouse interaction

Bosun captures the mouse in the outer terminal (SGR 1006) and routes
events itself. The big interactions:

- **Click a session row** → jump selection to it. If you were focused
  in the embed, the click also exits focus.
- **Click inside the preview** while unfocused → enter focus on the
  selected session. The triggering click isn't passed through into the
  embed (macOS click-to-focus convention); subsequent clicks under
  Focused mode are.
- **Drag the divider** → resize the list / preview split. The position
  is persisted to `config.toml` as `divider_x`.
- **Scroll wheel over the sidebar** → scroll the list.
- **Inside a focused embed** → mouse events are forwarded to the inner
  app via SGR 1006 (when the inner app has mouse tracking enabled),
  except when you're mid-drag on the divider — that drag completes
  even when the cursor crosses into the preview pane.

## Themes

Fifteen themes ship built in (ten dark, five light). Press `t` on the
main list to open the picker — arrow keys live-preview the whole UI
including the modal itself, `Enter` applies and writes the choice to
`config.toml`, `Esc` reverts.

Dark:

- `opencode` (default)
- `tokyonight`
- `dracula`
- `catppuccin-mocha`
- `one-dark-pro`
- `ayu-mirage`
- `nord`
- `gruvbox-dark`
- `rose-pine`
- `github-dark`

Light:

- `github-light`
- `one-light`
- `solarized-light`
- `ayu-light`
- `quiet-light`

### Custom themes

Drop a `<name>.toml` into `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/bosun/themes/` (on macOS:
`~/Library/Application Support/dev.yetidevworks.bosun/themes/`) and it
shows up in the picker alongside the built-ins. User themes override
built-ins of the same name. A theme is a set of hex colors for 13
semantic slots:

```toml
name = "my-theme"

bg             = "#0b0d12"   # deepest background
panel          = "#11141b"   # session list row bg
panel_alt      = "#131722"   # status bar + modal bg
selection_bg   = "#1e2433"   # selected row / focused field
text           = "#e6e9ef"
text_muted     = "#7c8495"
accent         = "#7c5cff"   # primary accent, selection marker, modal bars, focus border
shadow         = "#05070b"   # modal drop shadow
dim_fg         = "#3c4254"   # dim-background foreground behind modals
status_running = "#62d98c"
status_waiting = "#f4c169"
status_idle    = "#7c8495"
status_error   = "#ff5d6b"
```

See `themes/opencode.toml` in the repo for the authoritative reference.

## Configuration

Bosun reads (in order of precedence):

1. Built-in defaults
2. `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/bosun/config.toml`
3. Environment variables

Example `config.toml`:

```toml
theme            = "tokyonight"
session_prefix   = "bosun-"     # bosun only manages sessions with this prefix
tmux_socket      = "bosun"      # dedicated tmux -L socket; "default" uses your shared socket
divider_x        = 50           # saved automatically when you drag the list/preview divider
preview_tick_ms  = 200          # fast-preview / live-status cadence; 0 disables the fast tick
single_window    = true         # `s` key persists this; Enter focuses in-place instead of full-screen attach
embed_enabled    = true         # set false to fall back to the polled-snapshot preview
show_group_in_title = false      # prefix grouped sessions as "group/session" in tab pills and terminal title
editor           = "zed"        # set via `bosun editor <cmd>`; used by the `e` key
banner_font      = "newsx"      # section banner font; cycled with `f` on a header
```

Sections, per-section font overrides, sidebar membership, session
history, and recent-sessions metadata are also persisted under
`[sidebar]`, `[session_history]`, etc. — bosun writes these
automatically, you don't need to hand-edit them.

Environment overrides:

| Var | Equivalent |
|-----|------------|
| `BOSUN_THEME` | `theme` |
| `BOSUN_PREFIX` | `session_prefix` (empty string = show all sessions) |
| `BOSUN_TMUX_SOCKET` | `tmux_socket` (empty or `default` = shared socket) |
| `BOSUN_PREVIEW_TICK_MS` | `preview_tick_ms` |
| `BOSUN_SINGLE_WINDOW` | `single_window` (`1` / `true` to enable) |
| `BOSUN_EMBED` | `embed_enabled` (`0` / `false` to disable) |
| `BOSUN_SHOW_GROUP_IN_TITLE` | `show_group_in_title` (`1` / `true` / `yes` / `on` to enable) |
| `BOSUN_LOG` | Tracing filter, e.g. `BOSUN_LOG=info` |

## How `Ctrl+Q` detach works

For a full-screen `tmux attach`, bosun installs a temporary root-table
binding just before handing the terminal to tmux:

```
tmux bind-key -T root C-q detach-client
tmux attach-session -t <name>    # blocks until you detach
tmux unbind-key -T root C-q      # on return
```

Per-attach install/uninstall (no refcount) keeps the return path under
50 ms. A panic hook ensures the binding is cleaned up even if bosun
dies unexpectedly — that path is exercised by a dedicated integration
test.

In single-window focus mode the chord works the same way from the
user's perspective, but the routing is different: bosun never gives up
the terminal, so `Ctrl+Q` is intercepted in bosun's own key handler
and triggers `exit_focus()` directly.

## Why a dedicated tmux socket

By default bosun runs on `tmux -L bosun`, which starts a separate tmux
server owned by the bosun process. Two reasons:

1. **macOS Keychain lineage.** Claude Code stores its auth tokens in
   the user's Keychain. macOS gates Keychain access by process tree.
   Bosun's tmux server is a child of bosun, which is a child of your
   login shell, so Claude sessions started inside bosun see your cached
   credentials. Sessions on a random long-lived tmux server started
   months ago by some other tool don't have that lineage and fail to
   authenticate.
2. **Isolation.** Bosun never touches your other tmux sessions,
   bindings, or status bar. If you want the opposite — bosun managing
   your main tmux server — set `BOSUN_TMUX_SOCKET=default`.

## Development

```sh
cargo run
BOSUN_LOG=info cargo run                       # tracing to stderr
cargo test                                     # unit + snapshot tests
cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings
cargo fmt --check
cargo test --features tmux-it                  # integration tests that spawn a real tmux
make install                                   # release build + replace ~/.local/bin/bosun
```

Snapshot tests use [`insta`](https://insta.rs/). After an intentional
UI change:

```sh
cargo install cargo-insta     # once
cargo insta accept            # accept all new snapshots
```
